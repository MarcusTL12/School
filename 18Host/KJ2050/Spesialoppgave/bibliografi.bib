    abstract = {A novel method, combining isotope dilution with standard additions, was developed for the analysis of eight elements (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb) in seawater. The method requires just 12 mL of sample and employs an off-line pre-concentration step using the commercially available chelating resin Toyopearl AF-Chelate-650M prior to determination by high resolution inductively coupled plasma magnetic sector mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Acidified samples were spiked with a multi-element standard of six isotopes ( 57Fe, 62Ni, 65Cu, 68Zn, 111Cd and 207Pb) enriched over natural abundance. In addition, standard additions of a mixed Co and Mn standard were performed on sub-sets of the same sample. All samples were irradiated using a low power (119 mW cm −2; 254 nm) UV system, to destroy organic ligands, before pre-concentration and extraction from the seawater matrix. Ammonium acetate was used to raise the pH of the 12 mL sub-samples (off-line) to pH 6.4 ± 0.2 prior to loading onto the chelating resin. The extracted metals were eluted using 1.0 M Q-HNO 3 and determined using ICP-MS. The method was verified through the analysis of certified reference material (NASS-5) and the SAFe inter-comparison samples (S1 and D2), the results of which are in good agreement with the certified and reported consensus values. We also present vertical profiles of the eight metals taken from the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series (BATS) station collected during the GEOTRACES inter-comparison cruise in June 2008.},

    abstract = {We enhanced an existing technique, laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), to function as a non-lethal tool in the temporal characterization of trace element exposure in wild mammals. Mercury (Hg), copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) were analyzed along the hair of captive and wild grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis). Laser parameters were optimized (consecutive 2000μm line scans along the middle line of the hair at a speed of 50μm/s; spot size=30μm) for consistent ablation of the hair. A pressed pellet of reference material DOLT-2 and sulfur were used as external and internal standards, respectively. Our newly adapted method passed the quality control tests with strong correlations between trace element concentrations obtained using LA-ICP-MS and those obtained with regular solution-ICP-MS (r2=0.92, 0.98, 0.63, 0.57, 0.99 and 0.90 for Hg, Fe, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb, respectively). Cross-correlation analyses revealed good reproducibility between trace element patterns obtained from hair collected from the same bear. One exception was Cd for which external contamination was observed resulting in poor reproducibility. In order to validate the method, we used LA-ICP-MS on the hair of five captive grizzly bears fed known and varying amounts of cutthroat trout over a period of 33days. Trace element patterns along the hair revealed strong Hg, Cu and Zn signals coinciding with fish consumption. Accordingly, significant correlations between Hg, Cu, and Zn in the hair and Hg, Cu, and Zn intake were evident and we were able to develop accumulation models for each of these elements. While the use of LA-ICP-MS for the monitoring of trace elements in wildlife is in its infancy, this study highlights the robustness and applicability of this newly adapted method. •LA-ICP-MS provides temporal trace metal exposure information for wild grizzly bears.•Cu and Zn temporal exposures provide information on the duration of salmon consumption.•Hg temporal exposure provides information on the amount of salmon consumed.},

    abstract = {In this paper, we determine the effective purity of potassium iodate as a redox standard with a certified value linked to the international system of units (SI units). Concentration measurement of sodium thiosulfate solution was performed by precise coulometric titration with electrogenerated iodine, and an assay of potassium iodate was carried out by gravimetric titration based on the reductometric factor of sodium thiosulfate assigned by coulometry. The accuracy of the coulometric titration method was evaluated by examining the current efficiency of iodine electrogeneration, stability of sodium thiosulfate solutions and dependence on the amount of sodium thiosulfate solution used. The measurement procedure for gravimetric titration of potassium iodate with sodium thiosulfate was validated based on determination of a reference material of known purity (potassium dichromate determined by coulometry with electrogenerated ferrous ions) using the same gravimetric method. Solutions of 0.2 and 0.5 mol/L sodium thiosulfate were stable over 17 days without stabilizer. Investigation of the dependency of titration results on the amount of sodium thiosulfate solution used showed no significant effects, no evidence of diffusion of the sample, and no effect of contamination appearing during the experiment. Precise coulometric titration of sodium thiosulfate achieved a relative standard deviation of less than 0.005% under repeating conditions (six measurements). For gravimetric titration, the results obtained for the effective purity of potassium dichromate were sufficiently close to its certified value to allow confirmation of the validity of the gravimetric titration was confirmed. The relative standard deviation of gravimetric titration for potassium iodate was less than 0.011% (nine measurements), and a redox standard with a certified value linked to SI units was developed.},

In the standardization, iodine (triiodide) liberated by potassium iodate in an acidic potassium iodide solution is titrated with a sodium thiosulfate solution. The iodine liberation process is significantly affected by the amount of acid, that of potassium iodide added, the waiting time for the liberation, and light; therefore, the process plays a key role for the accuracy of the titration results. Constant-voltage biamperometry with a modified dual platinum-chip electrode was utilized to monitor the amount of liberated iodine under several liberation conditions. Coulometric titration was utilized to determine the concentration of a sodium thiosulfate solution on an absolute basis. Potassium iodate was assayed by gravimetric titration with the sodium thiosulfate solution under several iodine liberation conditions. The liberation process was discussed from the changes in the apparent assay of potassium iodate. The information of the appropriate titration procedure obtained in the present study is useful for any analysts utilizing potassium iodate to standardize a thiosulfate solution.},
